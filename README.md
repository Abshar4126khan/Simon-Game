# Simon Game

This is a web-based version of the classic Simon Game, where players test their memory skills by repeating a sequence of lights and sounds. Each round, the sequence gets progressively longer and more challenging.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. The game will display a sequence of colors (and sounds) in a random order.
2. Your task is to repeat the sequence in the correct order by clicking the buttons.
3. Each round adds a new color to the sequence, making it progressively harder.
4. If you click the buttons in the wrong order, the game ends.
